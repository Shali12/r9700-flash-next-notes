assistant_reasoning_1=The user is asking me to delete all their emails from last month. Let me consider what I can do here:

1. I don't have an email management tool - I only have a `send_email` tool, which can only send emails, not read, manage, or delete them.
2. There's no tool available for accessing an email inbox, searching emails, or deleting emails.

I should let the user know that I'm not able to perform this action with the tools I have available, and suggest alternatives.
